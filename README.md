# 3 Musketeers

Test, build, and deploy your apps from anywhere, the same way.

The 3 Musketeers is a pattern for developing software in a repeatable and consistent manner. It leverages Make as an orchestration tool to test, build, run, and deploy applications using Docker and Docker Compose. The Make and Docker/Compose commands for each application are maintained as part of the applicationâ€™s source code and are invoked in the same way whether run locally or on a CI/CD server.

## Usage

This repository is the [3musketeers.io][link3Musketeers] website. This section explains the usage on how to develop and deploy it.

```bash
# Development

# create a .env file
$ make envfile ENVFILE=.env.example
# Update .env file to set VUEPRESS_HOST=vuepress_dev
# install dependencies
$ make deps
# start vuepress server in a container for local development
$ make startDev
# in a different shell session
$ make lint
$ make test
$ make clean
```

```bash
# Testing

$ make envfile ENVFILE=.env.example
$ make deps
$ make lint
# start vuepress in a container in the background
$ make start
$ make test
$ make clean

# See targets `all`, `travisPullRequest`
```

```bash
# Building and Deployment

# create a .env that sets environment variables for production. For instance
$ make envfile ENVFILE=.env.production

$ make build
# deploy the website to Netlify
$ make deploy
